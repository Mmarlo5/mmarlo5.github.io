## 🖋️ Who I Am

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Public Affairs & Community Development at Rutgers University–Camden (2022–Present). My research develops original measures of policy–opinion alignment to evaluate how closely state laws reflect the preferences of residents, with a specific focus on **U.S. abortion legislation (2000–2024)**. My work utilizes longitudinal survey data to examine how closely state-level abortion policy aligns with public opinion on abortion.

Beyond the data:
* ☕ **Fuel:** Powered by strong coffee.
* 📚 **Fiction:** Always in the middle of a good novel (suggestions welcome!).
* 🏰 **The "Happy Place":** Huge fan of Disney Parks and Disney Cruises—I'm a believer that world-class logistics are best solved on a ship or at a Disney theme park.
