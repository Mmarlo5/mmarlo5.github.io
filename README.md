## About

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Public Affairs & Community Development at Rutgers University–Camden. My research examines the relationship between public opinion and state policy, with a focus on policy congruence in U.S. abortion legislation from 1973–2024.

I develop original measures of policy–opinion alignment to evaluate how closely state laws reflect the preferences of residents, with particular attention to gender differences, regional variation, and policy feedback effects.

## Research Interests

**Topics:** Public opinion; policy congruence; reproductive rights; state politics; survey methods.  
**Current projects:** Examining the alignment between state abortion policy and public opinion by developing original measures of policy–opinion congruence. This work utilizes longitudinal survey and state-level policy data to evaluate gender differences and policy feedback effects.

---

## Research Agenda

My broader research agenda focuses on democratic representation, public opinion, and the relationship between citizens and policymaking institutions. I am particularly interested in how policy responsiveness varies across states and how policy environments shape individual attitudes over time.

Future work extends this framework to examine gendered policy congruence, regional political cultures, and the long-term effects of policy change on public opinion.

## Dissertation

**Policy Congruence and Public Opinion on Abortion in the United States (2000–2024)**

This project develops an original framework for measuring the alignment between public opinion and state abortion policy across U.S. states over time. Using longitudinal survey data and state-level policy indicators, the dissertation examines both the direction and magnitude of the policy–opinion gap and explores how institutional context, partisanship, and gender shape congruence.
