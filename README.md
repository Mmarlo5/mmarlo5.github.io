## 🖋️ Who I Am
I am a Ph.D. [cite_start]Candidate at Rutgers University–Camden (2022–Present)[cite: 2, 10]. [cite_start]My research examines the vital intersection of **public opinion and state-level policy**, specifically developing original measures of policy-opinion congruence in U.S. abortion legislation from 2000–2024[cite: 5, 11].

Beyond the data:
* ☕ **Fuel:** Powered by strong coffee.
* 📚 **Fiction:** Always in the middle of a good novel (suggestions welcome!).
* 🏰 **The "Happy Place":** Huge fan of Disney Parks and Disney Cruises—I'm a believer that world-class logistics are best solved on a ship or at a Disney theme park.
