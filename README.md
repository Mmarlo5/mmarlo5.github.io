## Who I Am

I am a Ph.D. Candidate at Rutgers University–Camden (2022–Present). I develop original measures of policy-opinion alignment to evaluate how closely state laws reflect the preferences of residents, with a specific focus on **U.S. abortion legislation (2000–2024)**. My work utilizes longitudinal survey data to examine how closely state-level abortion policy aligns with public opinion on abortion.

Beyond the data:
* ☕ **Fuel:** Powered by strong coffee.
* 📚 **Fiction:** Always in the middle of a good novel (suggestions welcome!).
* 🏰 **The "Happy Place":** Huge fan of Disney Parks and Disney Cruises—I'm a believer that world-class logistics are best solved on a ship or at a Disney theme park.


##  Featured Research
> **Policy Congruence and Public Opinion on Abortion in the United States (2000–2024)** <*Dissertation Project*> I examine how institutional context, partisanship, and political ideology shape the representation gap in the U.S. using state-level policy indicators.
