## Who I am? 
I am a Ph.D. Candidate at Rutgers University–Camden, where I study the intersection of **public opinion and state-level policy**. My dissertation focuses on developing original measures of policy-opinion congruence in U.S. abortion legislation from 2000–2024.

Beyond the data:
* ☕ **Fuel:** Powered by strong coffee.
* 📚 **Fiction:** Always in the middle of a good novel (suggestions welcome!).
* 🏰 **The "Happy Place":** Huge fan of Disney Parks and Disney Cruises—I'm a believer that world-class logistics are best solved on a ship or at the Magic Kingdom.
